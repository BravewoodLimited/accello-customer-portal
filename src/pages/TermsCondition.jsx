            IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND OUR TERMS AND
            CONDITIONS BEFORE ACCESSING OUR LOAN FACILITY. THIS DOCUMENT GOVERNS
            YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BRAVEWOOD FINANCE COMPANY LIMITED AND SHALL
            BE INCORPORATED AND BE READ JOINTLY WITH YOUR LOAN APPLICATION. THE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL BE LEGALLY BINDING JUST
            AS THEY WOULD BE IF YOU WERE TO FILL OUT AND SIGN A PAPER TERMS AND
            CONDITIONS. THE TERMS AS CONTAINED HEREIN WILL BE LEGALLY BINDING
            FROM THE MOMENT YOU INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE TO THEM AND NO EXCHANGE
            OF SIGNED PAPER COPIES IS REQUIRED FOR THEM TO BE ENFORCEABLE.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            By proceeding with your application, you agree that these terms and
            conditions form a binding agreement between you and Bravewood
            Finance Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as “ACCELLO”, “we”
            “our” or “us”) and waive any notice requirements of the same. These
            terms will apply to you throughout the duration of the loan or as
            long as any part of the loan remains outstanding. These terms and
            conditions may be extended to cover any application for additional
            loan facilities (loan top up) while the initial loan is still
            running. You hereby represent and warrant that you are 18 years of
            age or older, of sound mind and gainfully employed by a reputable
            organisation. You also agree to provide us with your accurate and
            current information as your failure to provide accurate and current
            information may result in ACCELLO being unable to accept or process
            your loan application. These terms and conditions shall remain in
            force as long as ACCELLO remains your creditor or as long as any
            part of your loan facility remains outstanding.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            Upon your application, ACCELLO shall conduct a know you customer
            (KYC) and credit assessment with credit bureaus and your credit
            report generated will determine whether you qualify for the loan
            facility. By agreeing to these terms and conditions and continuing
            with our loan application process, you expressly consent to ACCELLO
            verifying and comparing your biodata, contact information, account
            information, location information and credit history to records of
            your information maintained by third parties, including credit
            reporting agencies, other financial institutions and
            telecommunication services providers, and you consent to such third
            parties providing such information to ACCELLO for the purpose of
            identity validation and credit assessment. For more information on
            how ACCELLO handles your personal information, please see our
            Privacy Policy as published and updated from time to time on our
            website.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            You hereby confirm that you applied for and were granted a loan
            facility in line with your loan application subject to ACCELLO’s
            approval which sum shall be paid into your personal bank account
            details as provided by you to ACCELLO. The tenor and interest rate
            of the loan shall be as agreed and communicated to you. The tenor
            shall run from the date of disbursement of the loan while the
            interest shall be charged on a flat basis monthly, depending on the
            loan product type. ACCELLO reserves the right to review the interest
            rate in line with the prevailing money market condition or for any
            reason at its sole discretion. Any change in the interest rate shall
            be communicated to you by way of any the communication methods
            indicated herein and shall be binding on you from the date of such
            notice. The disbursement of the loan amount shall be subject to
            availability of funds as well as Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s
            regulations. ACCELLO shall however not be responsible for any losses
            that you may sustain (or damages/claims accruing therefrom) arising
            from delay or failure of ACCELLO to approve a loan application
            within a given period of time or at all.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            By proceeding with your application and accessing the loan facility,
            you hereby covenant to repay the loan as and when due. The repayment
            sum shall be a computation of the monthly value of the loan and
            monthly interest calculation and shall be repaid in equal monthly
            installments for the duration of the loan or until the entire loan
            is liquidated. You hereby understand and consent that the settlement
            of your monthly repayments is automated and shall be deducted at
            source from your employer’s payroll, via direct debit (using Remita)
            or via your debit card from your monthly salary or any other sources
            of income paid into your designated bank account provided to us. You
            hereby undertake that your designated bank account will not be
            changed throughout the duration of the loan and shall be
            sufficiently funded upfront to absorb the monthly liquidation of the
            repayments. You may also choose to make your repayments by issuing a
            standing order on your bank account or debit card, post-dated
            cheques or pledged security. In the event of missed, omitted or
            default payments, ACCELLO may direct you to make payments into its
            nominated bank account and you are advised to give ACCELLO at least
            48 hours’ notice by sending an email to loans@accello.ng or call
            01-0000000 before any payments are lodged, to avoid double debits.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            In the event that you fail to repay the loan as agreed, and the loan
            becomes delinquent, ACCELLO shall have the right to report the
            delinquent loan to the CBN through the Credit Risk Management System
            (CRMS) or by any other means, and request the CBN to exercise its
            regulatory power to direct all banks and other financial
            institutions under its regulatory purview to set-off such
            indebtedness from any money standing to your credit in any bank
            account and from any financial assets they may be holding for your
            benefit. You also covenant and warrant that ACCELLO shall have power
            to activate a global standing instruction (GSI) to set-off your
            indebtedness from all such monies and funds standing to your
            credit/benefit in any and all such accounts or from any other
            financial assets belonging to you and in the custody of any such
            bank. Accordingly, you agree that you hereby waive any right of
            confidentiality whether arising under common law or statute or in
            any other manner whatsoever and irrevocably agree that you shall not
            contest this before any court of law, tribunal, administrative
            authority or any other body acting in any judicial or quasi-judicial
            capacity.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            It is hereby agreed that you understand that ACCELLO may apply the
            repayments to interest charges, outstanding fees, default charges,
            legal or recovery cost (where necessary) before the principal loan
            amount. ACCELLO also reserves the right to register your details
            with any credit bureau, collection agency and/or your employers if
            and when the loan has ceased to be serviced for continuing periods
            and you hereby waive any claim you may have against ACCELLO in
            respect of such disclosure. It is also agreed that you understand
            and permit ACCELLO to explore and utilise any lawful means as may be
            necessary to recover any outstanding which you may owe ACCELLO. In
            the event that you die or become permanently disabled, you hereby
            agree that you shall be liable for the repayment of any other
            outstanding limited to your terminal benefit/gratuity or any other
            disclosed/undisclosed entitlement from your employers (if any).
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            It is also understood and agreed that you shall reimburse ACCELLO
            for all out-of-pocket costs, charges and expenses which may have
            been incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
            execution, perfection, enforcement, management and administration of
            your loan application including such expenses as legal fees, costs
            of printing (if you request for paper copies), recovery expenses in
            the event of default, and otherwise as may be incurred by ACCELLO in
            respect of this transaction.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            You shall be deemed to be in breach of these covenants if and when
            you default in the repayment of any principal monies or in the
            payment of any interest due, penalty interest and any other expenses
            hereunder. Default penalty interest charged shall not exceed the
            maximum allowable rate in the terms of the notice on overdue amounts
            in case of your default or that of your employer. You hereby agree
            to fully indemnify and hold harmless ACCELLO against all
            liabilities, losses, damages, costs, fees and expenses in respect of
            injury or damage to ACCELLO arising from your default or breach of
            these terms and conditions. Any failure or delay by ACCELLO in
            exercising any remedy, power or right as a lender shall not be
            considered as a waiver or impairment nor shall it affect or impair
            any such remedies, powers or rights in respect of such default. The
            amount which you owe ACCELLO at any time may be ascertained from the
            ACCELLO online lending platform or as shown by a letter of
            indebtedness and stated therein as the amount owed, which letter
            must be prepared and signed by a ACCELLO official either physically
            or electronically. The letter of indebtedness will be proof of the
            amount owed to ACCELLO and will be used in any legal proceedings and
            will be accepted by the Court on its own as correct. ACCELLO shall
            also endeavour to furnish you with a statement setting out all
            deductions from your repayment source, your outstanding loan balance
            and any amounts payable in arrears, upon your request of same.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            By virtue of these covenants, you hereby declare and undertake that
            the representations or warranties (including your financial
            information) given or made in your loan application or in any
            notice, certificate or statement, delivered or made pursuant to your
            loan application is true and accurate in every respect when made or
            delivered. You further undertake to:

              Ensure that the monthly repayments are made as and when due.

            <li>Notify any other lender of your indebtedness to ACCELLO.</li>
            <li>
              Immediately notify ACCELLO of any change in circumstances or any

            <li>
              Immediately inform ACCELLO of any material adverse change in your

            <li>
              Inform ACCELLO within 2 days of a transfer, resignation,
              retirement, termination, or dismissal event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inform ACCELLO of all cash advances, internal loans, financial
              accommodations, or any other obligations which you may have been
              granted and deductible from your monthly salaries within 24 hours
              of occurrence.

            <li>
              Notify ACCELLO of all terminal benefits/entitlements including but
              not limited to shares/staff investment trust benefits, cooperative
              society contributions, benefits, or entitlements credited to your
              account upon your disengagement from current employment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide ACCELLO with any other information upon ACCELLO’s request
              of the same.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-8">
            With respect to the communication methods under this transaction, no
            communication will be effective until received by ACCELLO in
            writing, either via surface mail, e-mail, or electronic messaging to
            ACCELLO’s specified physical or electronic addresses. ACCELLO will
            use either or all of the communication methods indicated hereunder
            to correspond with you (or your next of kin as provided in your
            application when you are consistently unreachable). ACCELLO’s
            communication to you is, however, deemed to be received, in the case
            of a letter, on the second business day after posting and in the
            case of electronic communications (emails or SMS), on completion of
            transmission to the relevant electronic address provided that if
            such communication is made at a time which is outside ordinary
            business hours, such communications shall be deemed received on the
            next business day. The term “business day” means a day (other than a
            Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday) upon which banks are open for
            business in Nigeria. In addition, ACCELLO may also publish notices
            of general nature, which are applicable to all its customers, on its
            website or national dailies. Such notices will have the same effect
            as a notice served individually to a customer. By virtue of this
            provision, it is deemed that you consent to receipt of notices,
            documents and any other communications relating to your loan
            facility and these terms and conditions being sent by ACCELLO via
            email or other electronic means (including without limitation, SMS,
            push notifications, publications on the ACCELLO website).
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            Only ACCELLO may amend, supplement, or vary the terms of your loan
            facility and these terms and conditions at any time if it is
            required or it is advisable for us to do so by law or change in
            market conditions or to maintain our rate of return on this
            facility. Any amendment, supplement or variation to these terms and
            conditions shall be binding on you from the date specified in such
            notice. An updated version of the terms and conditions shall be sent
            to the email address provided at the time of submitting your loan
            application. You are however responsible for ensuring you check your
            email regularly to receive notices from ACCELLO in a timely manner.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in
            accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria
            irrespective of where you live or were located when you applied for
            the loan and both parties shall submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
            of the Courts of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If any provision
            of this document is found by any Court of competent jurisdiction to
            be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall not affect other
            provisions herein, which shall remain in full force and effect and
            ACCELLO undertakes to use reasonable endeavours to find a new
            provision resembling the invalid one, taking the original intent and
            purpose into consideration.
